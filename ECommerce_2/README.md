# ecommerce_dbs
This is an ecommerce web application developed using Reactjs,Nodejs to develop this. I used Expressjs as middleware. I used sequelize library of nodejs to perform all the transactions.

I have designed two databases - ecommerce and banks. Because it is inappropriate and unsecure to store accountdetails in ecommerce database. Payment gateway will take care of communication between these databases.
